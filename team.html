        <p>Hi! My name is T.J. Kennedy Jr. and I'm a fledgling coder from Cleveland, OH. I've been interested in web
            design and
            coding for a while and wanted to do something where I can flex my creative muscles, make some great art and
            make people
            happy in the process!!</p>
